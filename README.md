## **üì° Image Transmission with Autoencoder & PSK Modulation**

This project simulates robust image transmission over noisy channels by combining deep learning (autoencoder) with classical signal processing (PSK). The implementation was divided into three phases:

**üîÑ Project Phases**

### Phase 1: Familiarization & Fundamentals

* Literature review on PSK modulation and AWGN channels
* Setting up a Python environment using Anaconda (incl. TensorFlow, NumPy, komm)
* Development of a baseline implementation without machine learning

### Phase 2: Classical Signal Processing

**[Python Script from Phase 2](/ISS%20‚Äì%20Deep%20Learning%20in%20communication%20technology%20project/main.py)**

* Manual feature extraction:

  * Direct conversion of image pixels into bitstreams

* PSK Modulation (QPSK):

  * Phase encoding of raw data

* Limitations:

  * No adaptation to image content
  * Susceptibility to noise

### Phase 3: Autoencoder Approach (Deep Learning)

**[Python Script from Phase 3](/ISS%20‚Äì%20Deep%20Learning%20in%20communication%20technology%20project/with_train.py)**

* Encoder:

  * Compresses images into a 64-D latent space

* PSK Transmission:

  * Modulates only the compressed representation

* Decoder:

  * Reconstructs images from noisy data

* Advantages:
  ‚úÖ Reduced bandwidth usage
  ‚úÖ Noise tolerance through feature learning
  ‚úÖ End-to-end trainability

### Phase 4: Conclusion

**[Presentation Slides from Phase 4](/ISS%20‚Äì%20Deep%20Learning%20in%20communication%20technology%20project/Presentation/Final_KI-ISS%20.pptx)**

* Presentation of results
* Comparison of both approaches (bit error rate, reconstruction quality)
